# OIBSIP_Task-1_Iris_Flower_Classification


The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and viriginica. These measurements include the length and width of the petals, and the length and width of the sepals, all measured in centimeters.

My goal is to build a machine learning model that can learn the measurements of these iris flowers, whose species are known, so that we can predict the species for a new iris flower.
logistic regression can actually be used as a model for classification. It uses a logistic function (or sigmoid) to convert any real-valued input $x$ into a predicted output value $ŷ$ that takes values between 0 and 1. Rounding $ŷ$ to the nearest integer effectively classifies the input as belonging either to class 0 or 1.
